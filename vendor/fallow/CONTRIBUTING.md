# Contributing to Fallow

Thanks for your interest in contributing to fallow! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fallow-rs/fallow.git
cd fallow
git config core.hooksPath .githooks    # Enable commit-msg/pre-commit/pre-push hooks
npm install                            # Install repo tooling such as commitlint
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

On Windows, enable symlink checkout support before cloning. If you already
cloned the repo, enable it and check out the repo again:

```bash
git config --global core.symlinks true
```

The CLI's bundled GitLab CI templates under `crates/cli/templates/ci/` are
symlinks to the canonical workspace sources under `ci/`. Cargo dereferences
them when packaging the published crate.

## Development workflow

### Building

```bash
cargo build --workspace              # Debug build
cargo build --release -p fallow-cli  # Release build (CLI only)
```

### Testing

```bash
cargo test --workspace               # All tests
cargo test -p fallow-core            # Single crate
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### Running locally

```bash
cargo run --bin fallow -- dead-code       # Unused code analysis
cargo run --bin fallow -- dupes           # Duplication detection
cargo run --bin fallow -- health          # Complexity metrics
cargo run --bin fallow -- fix --dry-run   # Auto-fix preview
cargo run --bin fallow -- list --plugins  # Show detected plugins
```

### Benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench --bench analysis                                    # Criterion benchmarks
cd benchmarks && npm run generate && npm run bench              # Comparative vs knip
cd benchmarks && npm run generate:dupes && npm run bench:dupes  # vs jscpd
cd benchmarks && npm run generate:circular && npm run bench:circular  # vs madge/dpdm
```

## Adding a framework plugin

The most common contribution is adding support for a new framework. Each plugin lives in `crates/core/src/plugins/` as a single Rust file.

1. Create `crates/core/src/plugins/my_framework.rs`
2. Implement the `Plugin` trait (see existing plugins for examples)
3. Register it in `crates/core/src/plugins/mod.rs`
4. Add tests

A minimal plugin needs:
- `name()` — framework name
- `enablers()` — package.json dependencies that activate the plugin
- `entry_patterns()` — glob patterns for entry point files
- Optionally: `resolve_config()` for AST-based config parsing

See the [Plugin Authoring Guide](docs/plugin-authoring.md) for the full trait API and external plugin format.

## Editing the JSON output contract

Fallow's JSON output schema lives in `docs/output-schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07) and is consumed by downstream tools (VS Code extension TypeScript codegen, GitHub Action jq scripts, AI agents using AJV validation).

The schema covers two layers, with different ownership rules:

### Layer 1: types derived from Rust

The per-finding structs in `crates/types/src/results.rs` and `crates/core/src/duplicates/types.rs`, the JSON-layer augmentation types in `crates/types/src/output.rs`, the per-finding action wrappers in `crates/types/src/output_health.rs`, the health output subtree in `crates/cli/src/health_types/`, the shared envelope and utility shapes in `crates/types/src/envelope.rs`, and the per-command envelope structs in `crates/cli/src/output_envelope.rs` all carry `#[cfg_attr(feature = "schema", derive(schemars::JsonSchema))]`. The full list of derived definitions is `derived_definition_names()` in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs`.

The health and envelope types live on `fallow-cli` (the binary crate) rather than `fallow-types`, so deriving `JsonSchema` on them required a sibling `schema` cargo feature on `fallow-cli`. The `schema-emit` feature now depends on `fallow-cli/schema` alongside `fallow-types/schema` + `fallow-core/schema`, so a single `cargo run -p fallow-cli --features schema-emit --bin fallow-schema-emit` covers the whole tree.

A drift gate (`cargo test -p fallow-cli --features schema-emit --bin fallow-schema-emit`) compares the derived shape against the committed `docs/output-schema.json` and fails when:
- a Rust struct gains a field that is missing from the schema,
- a Rust struct loses a field that is still listed in the schema,
- a Rust field is required but the schema has it optional (or vice versa),
- any structural divergence on the Rust-owned definitions (full equality after canonicalization erases cosmetic differences: doc-comment prose, `oneOf`/`anyOf` choice, single-arm `allOf` wrappers, schemars integer-width hints, `Option<T>` nullable-union form).

To regenerate `docs/output-schema.json` against the Rust source of truth:

```bash
cargo run -p fallow-cli --features schema-emit --bin fallow-schema-emit > docs/output-schema.json
```

Phase 8 closed the prose-and-shape escape hatch: every type in `derived_definition_names()` is regenerated from Rust, with descriptions sourced from `///` doc comments and per-envelope titles from `#[schemars(title = "...")]`. Editing the committed schema by hand on any in-scope definition will fail the strict gate on the next `cargo test`.

### Layer 2: hand-written sections

The following surfaces of `docs/output-schema.json` stay hand-maintained today:

- **Top-level metadata** (`$schema`, `$id`, `$comment`, `title`); the `merge_with_committed` step in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs` preserves them verbatim. `$id` is the canonical raw GitHub URL and is used by consumers to SHA-pin a schema revision (see `docs/backwards-compatibility.md`). `description` is now overwritten by `rewrite_document_root_one_of` to keep it in sync with the typed root.
- **Definitions in `HAND_MAINTAINED_ALLOW_LIST`** inside `drift_tests` in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs`: today this is `CloneFamilyAction`, `CloneGroupAction`, and `CoverageAnalyzeOutput`. Each entry carries a reason linking it to the meta-issue ladder rung that retires it. The strict drift gate's orphan check fires on any other hand-maintained definition, so the allow-list is the canonical record of what stays hand-written and why.
- **`CoverageAnalyzeOutput`** is also listed in `HAND_MAINTAINED_ROOT_ENVELOPES` so it remains reachable from the document root; the `hand_maintained_root_envelopes_appear_in_root_one_of` drift test fires if the entry is silently dropped from the root `oneOf`.

The `committed_property_refs_match_derived_property_refs` drift test catches `$ref`-value drift between derived and committed property shapes (e.g. if a future change repoints `CombinedOutput.dupes` away from `DuplicationReport`); this is a check, not a hand-maintained section.

The document-root `oneOf` is now derived from Rust as of #384 item 6: the typed `FallowOutput` enum (in `crates/cli/src/output_envelope.rs`) wraps every object-shaped envelope and emits the root union via the `rewrite_document_root_one_of` step in `crates/cli/src/bin/schema_emit.rs`. Editing the root `oneOf` by hand will be reverted on the next regeneration. The root union is `[FallowOutput, CodeClimateOutput, ...HAND_MAINTAINED_ROOT_ENVELOPES]`: `CodeClimateOutput` (a bare JSON array via `#[serde(transparent)]`) is a sibling branch because the planned future move to `#[serde(tag = "kind")]` requires every variant of `FallowOutput` to serialize as an object, which the Code Climate / GitLab Code Quality spec forbids for that one envelope.

If you add a new finding type or utility shape, derive `JsonSchema` on the matching Rust struct, register it in `derived_definition_names()`, and the drift gate forces the schema to follow. **Adding a new top-level envelope** also requires adding a new variant to `FallowOutput` in `crates/cli/src/output_envelope.rs` so the document root keeps documenting every wire shape.

### After editing the schema

If `docs/output-schema.json` changed, regenerate the VS Code extension's TypeScript types:

```bash
cd editors/vscode
pnpm run codegen:types   # writes editors/vscode/src/generated/output-contract.d.ts
```

CI runs `pnpm run check:codegen` to confirm the committed generated file matches a fresh regeneration.

## Git conventions

- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- **Commit linting**: `npm run commitlint -- --last --verbose` uses the same rule set as CI
- **Signed commits**: `git commit -S`
- Pre-commit hooks run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` automatically

## Code style

- Follow existing patterns — the codebase is consistent
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` must pass (pedantic lints enabled)
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` must pass
- No `unsafe` without justification
- Prefer early returns with guard clauses

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes with conventional commit messages
4. Ensure `cargo test --workspace` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` pass
