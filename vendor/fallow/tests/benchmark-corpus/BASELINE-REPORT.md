# Fallow Duplication Accuracy Baseline

**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Fallow version:** current main (commit HEAD)
**Corpus:** Custom curated JS/TS benchmark (`tests/benchmark-corpus/`)

## Methodology

### Corpus Design

14 TypeScript files across 5 categories:

| Category | Files | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Type-1 (exact) | 4 | Identical copies: DataProcessor class (143 lines), LRUCache class (132 lines) |
| Type-2 (renamed) | 4 | Same structure, all identifiers renamed: HTTP client, Event bus |
| Type-3 (near-miss) | 4 | Added/removed/modified statements: FormValidator, PriorityQueue |
| Type-4 (semantic) | 2 | Same semantics, different implementation: quicksort vs mergesort |
| Negative | 3 | Structurally different: AuthService, FileWatcher, ConnectionPool |

### Ground Truth

- **7 clone pairs** with expected detection per mode
- **5 negative pairs** (should not be detected)
- Each pair has minimum overlap threshold

### Evaluation

- **True Positive (TP):** Ground truth pair detected with >= min_overlap_lines
- **False Positive (FP):** Detection between negative pairs, or Type-4 detection (beyond token-based capability)
- **False Negative (FN):** Expected pair not detected in a mode where it should be
- Settings: `--min-tokens 30 --min-lines 3` (lowered from defaults to capture smaller clone fragments)

## Results

### Summary Table

| Mode | Groups | TP | FP | FN | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|------|--------|----|----|------|-----------|--------|------|
| **strict** | 28 | 4 | 0 | 0 | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |
| **mild** | 28 | 4 | 0 | 0 | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |
| **weak** | 29 | 4 | 0 | 0 | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |
| **semantic** | 35 | 6 | 2 | 0 | **75.0%** | **100.0%** | **85.7%** |
| **defaults** | 11 | 4 | 0 | 0 | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |

> Note: "defaults" uses `--min-tokens 50 --min-lines 5` (production settings).

### Per Clone Type

| Type | Pairs | Strict | Mild | Weak | Semantic |
|------|-------|--------|------|------|----------|
| Type-1 (exact) | 2 | 2/2 | 2/2 | 2/2 | 2/2 |
| Type-2 (renamed) | 2 | 0/0 expected | 0/0 expected | 0/0 expected | **2/2** |
| Type-3 (near-miss) | 2 | 2/2 | 2/2 | 2/2 | 2/2 |
| Type-4 (semantic) | 1 | 0/0 correct | 0/0 correct | 0/0 correct | 1 (FP) |

### Per-Pair Detail

| Pair ID | Type | Strict | Mild | Weak | Semantic | Overlap |

| T2-http | type-2 | TN | TN | TN | **TP (136 lines)** | Full file |
| T2-eventbus | type-2 | TN | TN | TN | **TP (123 lines)** | Full file |
| T3-validator | type-3 | TP (32 lines) | TP | TP | TP (35 lines) | Shared switch cases |
| T3-queue | type-3 | TP (25 lines) | TP | TP | TP (25 lines) | Binary search + updatePriority |
| T4-sort | type-4 | TN | TN | TN | FP (16 lines) | Binary search helper |

## False Positive Analysis

### Semantic Mode (2 FPs)

1. **NEG-auth-vs-cache (Group 20):** Interface declarations with similar `{ string; number; }` field patterns matched when identifiers are blinded. AuthToken vs CacheEntry: both have 4-5 typed fields → structural similarity after blinding. 12 lines overlap.

2. **NEG-auth-vs-watcher (Group 14):** Similar pattern — interface blocks with `string`/`number` fields match when identifiers are blinded. 15 lines overlap.

**Root cause:** Semantic mode blinds all identifiers and literals, which makes structurally similar TypeScript interfaces (sequences of `field: type;` declarations) look identical. This is an inherent trade-off of aggressive normalization.

### Type-4 Sort Detection (1 FP in semantic)

The `binarySearch`/`searchSorted` helper functions share structural similarity after identifier blinding (both are `while` loops with `mid` computation and comparison). This is actually a legitimate Type-2 sub-clone within the Type-4 pair — the binary search functions genuinely have the same structure.

## Key Observations

1. **Strict/Mild equivalence:** Confirmed identical results (expected, since both preserve identifiers with AST-based tokenization; whitespace/comments already absent).

2. **Weak mode:** Nearly identical to strict/mild. String literal blinding found 1 additional group (29 vs 28) but no new cross-file matches. Confirms the corpus has minimal string-literal-only variation.

3. **Semantic mode strengths:** Successfully detects Type-2 renamed clones (the primary use case for identifier blinding). Full-file overlap detected for both HTTP client and Event bus pairs.

4. **Semantic mode weakness:** Over-matches on TypeScript interface declarations. This is predictable — interface bodies become sequences of `IDENT: IDENT;` which are very common.

5. **Fragment granularity:** Strict mode found 28 groups from just 7 pairs because it correctly identifies sub-fragments (individual method matches within larger clone pairs). The Type-3 near-miss pairs generate 5-10 sub-groups each for the shared code blocks.

6. **Default settings are conservative:** With `min-tokens=50, min-lines=5`, only 11 groups are reported — all accurate, no FPs. The defaults are well-calibrated for production use.

## Recommendations

1. **For CI adoption:** Use default settings (`mild`, `min-tokens=50`, `min-lines=5`). Zero FPs in this benchmark.

2. **For deep analysis:** Use `semantic` mode but filter results — interface-only matches are noise. Consider adding heuristic to down-weight pure interface/type alias matches.

3. **Potential improvement:** Add optional `--exclude-interfaces` or `--min-code-ratio` flag to filter groups where > 80% of matched tokens are type declarations.
