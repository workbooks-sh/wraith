Review Rust code changes in the fallow project. Focus on:

## What to check
1. **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases, panic paths
2. **Performance**: Unnecessary allocations, missing `&str` over `String`, clone() where borrow works
3. **Project conventions**:
   - `#[expect(clippy::...)]` not `#[allow]`
   - `FxHashMap`/`FxHashSet` instead of `HashMap`/`HashSet`
   - Size assertions on hot-path structs
   - Early returns with guard clauses
4. **Cross-platform**: Path separator issues (use `.replace('\\', "/")` in tests)
5. **Cache friendliness**: Flat storage patterns, avoid Arc/Rc where not needed

## Surface-specific checks

For each Rust-touching diff, walk this list in addition to the generic checks above:

- [ ] **`#[expect]` over `#[allow]`**: all new clippy/compiler lint suppressions use `#[expect]`
- [ ] **No panics in non-test code**: no `unwrap()` or `expect()` on user-facing paths
- [ ] **Struct constructors complete**: if you added a field to a struct, grep for ALL constructors of that struct in the entire codebase (tests included). Rust catches this at compile time, but test code may lag.
- [ ] **Cache version bumped**: if extraction logic changed (new/modified visitor handlers, changed `member_accesses`/`whole_object_uses`/`MemberInfo` output), verify `CACHE_VERSION` in `crates/extract/src/cache/types.rs` was incremented. Without this, stale cached data persists and the fix has no effect for users with warm caches.
- [ ] **Glob matching uses relative paths**: any `GlobSet::is_match()` or `GlobMatcher::is_match()` on user-supplied patterns (`ignorePatterns`, `health.ignore`, `duplicates.ignore`, `overrides.files`, boundary zone patterns) must match against a path stripped of the project root via `path.strip_prefix(&config.root).unwrap_or(path)`. User patterns are relative (e.g., `src/generated/**`), but walker entries and graph paths are absolute. Matching without stripping silently fails for patterns without `**/` prefix.
- [ ] **Regex line-ending portability**: any regex in extraction code (`crates/extract/`) that uses literal `\n` for line boundaries must use `\r?\n` instead. Windows CI checks out files with CRLF (`\r\n`), and `\n`-only patterns silently fail to match. Applies to: SFC parsers (`sfc.rs`), Astro frontmatter (`astro.rs`), MDX extraction (`mdx.rs`), HTML extraction (`html.rs`). Grep for `\\n` in regex strings: `grep -n '\\\\n' crates/extract/src/*.rs | grep -v 'r\?\\\\n'`.
- [ ] **Decorator-based credit must validate the framework import source**: if the change adds detection that flips a flag, credits an export, or skips a check based on a class decorator (`@customElement`, `@Component`, `@Injectable`, `@Controller`, `@Get`, `@Pipe`, `@Module`, `@Entity`, etc.), the credit must be gated against an import whose `source` is the framework's actual module path (e.g. `lit/decorators.js`, `@angular/core`, `@nestjs/common`, `typeorm`) AND whose imported symbol resolves to the canonical decorator name. Matching only on the syntactic callee identifier (`Expression::Identifier(id) if id.name == "customElement"`) credits any local function with that name and produces silent false negatives on unused-export. The validator must compare both sides: `ImportInfo.local_name == decorator_callee_name` AND `ImportedName::Named(canonical) | ImportedName::Namespace`. Named-aliased imports (`import { customElement as ce }`) and namespace-call shapes (`@decorators.customElement('x')`) both flow through this check by tracking the local binding through the imports list. Verification grep: for every new pattern that matches a decorator callee by NAME alone, search for an accompanying check against an `ImportInfo.source` constant. Companion check: ship a negative-case fixture where a local function with the same name decorates a class, asserting the export is still reported as unused. Existing precedent: `extract_angular_inject_target` gates the `inject` callee against `@angular/core`. Caught 2026-05-05 on the Lit `@customElement` PR after the implement-phase visitor matched the bare identifier name.
- [ ] **Audit ALL plugin discovery phases before claiming a behavior fix**: when a change touches plugin/registry path semantics or workspace bucketing (`crates/core/src/plugins/registry/`, `crates/core/src/lib.rs::bucket_files_by_workspace`, `run_workspace_fast`), list every discovery phase (Phase 1 dep activation, Phase 2 static patterns, Phase 3a relative_files matcher, Phase 3b filesystem fallback) and identify which the change affects. A regression in one phase may not surface end-to-end if a sibling phase covers the same ground. Concrete check: write a SCENARIO test where ONLY the changed phase can find the config file (e.g., for Phase 3a: place the config file at a location Phase 3b cannot reach, such as `apps/web/sub/vite.config.ts` since Phase 3b only scans `workspace_root` non-recursively for non-`**/` patterns). Also: globset literal/brace patterns basename-match across path components, so do not assume `pattern.ts` requires the path to be exactly `pattern.ts`. Caught 2026-04-29 on the workspace plugin-bucketing change in `crates/core/src/lib.rs`: review called it a "meaningful behavior fix" but Phase 3b filesystem fallback already covered workspace-local configs, making the change mostly a perf optimization. Cross-ref `project_workspace_plugin_discovery_phases.md`.
- [ ] **Node-builtin callee gates must accept both prefixed and bare source forms**: when reviewing a callee-import gate where the gated source is a Node builtin (`node:module`, `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:url`, `node:crypto`, `node:os`, `node:child_process`, `node:stream`, `node:buffer`, `node:events`, `node:net`, `node:http`, `node:https`, `node:zlib`, etc.), confirm the gate accepts BOTH `node:M` AND bare `M` (Node still resolves the bare form for backwards compatibility with code from before the `node:` prefix was added in Node 16). Concrete grep target during review: when the diff calls `is_named_import_from(_, "node:M", _)` for any Node-builtin M, also grep for a sibling call against bare `"M"`. If absent, flag CONCERN and require a wrapper helper that accepts both (pattern: `is_node_module_register_import` calling `is_named_import_from` twice). Caught 2026-05-06 on issue #293: narrow gate against `"node:module"` silently rejected `import { register } from 'module'` used by turbopack's own test fixture.
- [ ] **Path-resolution fixes that swap project_root mid-pipeline must absolutize at the public entry point**: when a fix introduces relative-path resolution against a `project_root` argument, grep for every recursive caller that DIFFERENTLY rebinds `project_root` (audit's `compute_base_snapshot` swaps to a worktree path; future cases might be cross-workspace recursion or any feature with multiple "root contexts"). For each such caller, the fix must absolutize at the OUTER entry point (e.g., `audit::run_audit`) so the inner recursion doesn't re-resolve against the wrong root. Pattern target list: any function in `audit.rs` / `combined.rs` / future cross-workspace driver that calls `run_audit_*` / `execute_*` with a recursively-rebuilt `AuditOptions` / `CheckOptions` / similar struct. The Phase 6 smoke that catches this kind of bug is "run from cwd != --root != base-worktree" with relative paths in flag values; if all three are the same path, the bug is invisible. Caught 2026-05-07 on the `--coverage` relative-path fix: `load_istanbul_coverage` resolved against the recursively-rebound `base_root` worktree path, breaking `audit --base` for relative `--coverage`.
- [ ] **Four parallel attribution surfaces for path-anchored issue types**: when the review covers a NEW issue type with a path-anchored finding, enumerate these four surfaces and confirm the new type appears in each: (1) `crates/core/src/changed_files.rs::filter_results_by_changed_files` (`--changed-since` retain); (2) `crates/cli/src/check/rules.rs::apply_rules` per-file override branch AND base branch; (3) `crates/cli/src/check/rules.rs::has_error_severity_issues` per-file iter AND base branch; (4) `crates/cli/src/audit.rs::dead_code_keys` + `retain_introduced_dead_code` + `annotate_dead_code_json` (audit attribution trio). Concrete grep target for each new finding type's array name:
  ```bash
  for path in crates/core/src/changed_files.rs crates/cli/src/check/rules.rs crates/cli/src/audit.rs; do
    echo "=== $path ==="
    grep -nE "<new_field_name>" "$path" || echo "  MISSING -- BLOCK"
  done
  ```
  Missing in any one = BLOCK. The audit trio is particularly easy to miss because the three functions are spread across 250+ lines and each has its own per-type loop; do not assume "the verdict count was right" implies all three are wired (the count comes from `dead_code_keys` which DOES key the type even when `retain_introduced_dead_code` and `annotate_dead_code_json` don't, so the attribution number can look right while the findings array is empty and the `introduced` field missing). Companion rule: when a new `Vec<X>` field on `AnalysisResults` has `X.path: PathBuf`, confirm `X.path` is stored as an ABSOLUTE filesystem path internally (NOT `strip_prefix`-ed) AND that JSON serialization uses `#[serde(serialize_with = "serde_path::serialize")]` to strip the root for output. Caught 2026-05-12 by codex's parallel /fallow-review on PR #340 (`unresolved-catalog-references`): three BLOCKs (changed-since filter, rules override, audit attribution trio) plus a storage-convention mismatch (relative-internal vs absolute-internal).
- [ ] **Verify plugin enablers activate on the fixture before relying on integration tests as regression-strength**: for any plugin-gated detection fix (the fix lives inside a `Plugin::resolve_config`, `Plugin::path_aliases`, `Plugin::config_patterns`, or any code path that runs only when a specific enabler matches), the fixture's `package.json` MUST list the enabler dep so the plugin is invoked during analysis. Common enablers: `typescript` (TypeScript plugin), `vite` (Vite plugin), `webpack` (Webpack plugin), `eslint` (ESLint plugin), `vitest` / `jest` / `mocha` (test plugins), `next` (Next.js), `nuxt` (Nuxt), `@angular/core` (Angular). Concrete pre-test check: open the fixture's `package.json` and confirm the enabler dep for the plugin whose code the fix touches is listed in `dependencies` OR `devDependencies`. Without it, the integration test silently exercises a code path the fix didn't change. Verification recipe: stash the fix, run the integration test, confirm it FAILS with an assertion message matching the expected pre-fix behavior. If the test passes on OLD source, either the fixture is missing the enabler dep, or the assertion is too loose, or the wrong code path is exercised. Caught 2026-05-11 on issue #327: `wildcard_tsconfig_paths_do_not_misclassify_bare_imports` fixture's `package.json` listed `@types/node` but not `typescript`, so the TypeScript plugin never ran, no `("", "src")` path-alias entry landed, and the bug couldn't reproduce on OLD source.
- [ ] **Verify library-behavior claims with a standalone test**: when the review's reasoning depends on how an external library (`globset`, `regex`, `serde_json`, `oxc_*`, `ureq`, etc.) treats some input class, do NOT rely on memory or comment claims about that library's behavior. Write a 10-line standalone repro and run it against the EXACT version pinned in `Cargo.lock`. Concrete recipe: `mkdir -p /tmp/lib-verify && cd /tmp/lib-verify && cargo init --bin && cargo add <crate>@<version-from-Cargo.lock>`, write the smallest probe that exercises the claimed behavior, `cargo run --release` and assert the output matches the claim. Memory rules and code comments can drift across library upgrades; the only durable verification is empirical against the current pinned version. When the verification contradicts a project memory, also UPDATE the memory rule with a corrected claim and a "verify with `cargo test ...`" pointer to a test that locks the new behavior in. Caught 2026-05-06 during perf-loop round 8: `project_workspace_plugin_discovery_phases.md` claimed bare globset patterns basename-match across path components, but a standalone repro against globset 0.4.18 showed bare `webpack.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs}` returned `false` against `apps/web/webpack.config.ts`; only the `**/`-prefixed form matched.

### Formula/algorithm review (if applicable)

- [ ] Unit tests cover: zero input, maximum input, boundary values, known-answer test
- [ ] Rounding: can JSON consumers reproduce computed fields from the other fields in the same object?
- [ ] Documented formula matches implementation exactly (no stale docs)
- [ ] Run on a real project, do top/bottom 5 results look reasonable?
- [ ] Unbounded values are capped (e.g., penalties, ratios)
- [ ] Denominators exclude irrelevant items (e.g., type-only exports in a value-export ratio)
- [ ] Degenerate inputs don't dominate rankings (e.g., zero-function files scoring worst)
- [ ] Aggregates (averages) computed over FULL dataset, not over `--top N` truncated subset
- [ ] Failed computation distinguishable from "flag not set" in output (e.g., `Some(0)` vs `None`)

## What NOT to flag
- Style preferences already enforced by rustfmt/clippy
- Missing docs on internal items
- Test organization choices

## Veto rights

Can **BLOCK** on:
- Unsafe code without justification
- Missing `--all-targets` in test/clippy commands
- `HashMap`/`HashSet` instead of `FxHashMap`/`FxHashSet`
- Panicking code (`unwrap`/`expect`) on user-facing paths

## Output format

Only report issues with HIGH confidence. For each issue:
- File and line
- What's wrong
- Suggested fix

End with a verdict:

```
## Verdict: APPROVE | CONCERN | BLOCK
```
