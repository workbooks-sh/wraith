Review changes to fallow's JSON output format. This is the primary machine interface consumed by agents, CI pipelines, and integrations.

## What to check

1. **Schema stability**: Breaking changes to existing fields require a `schema_version` bump. Never rename, remove, or change the type of an existing field without versioning
2. **Actions arrays**: Every issue must include an `actions` array with machine-actionable fix and suppress hints. Check `auto_fixable` is set correctly
3. **Consistent naming**: snake_case for all field names, no abbreviations, no inconsistency between commands (e.g., `unused_exports` not `unusedExports`)
4. **Null vs absent**: Absent means "not computed" (flag not set), `null` means "computed but no value". Never mix these semantics
5. **Metadata with `--explain`**: `_meta` objects must include value ranges, definitions, and interpretation hints for every numeric field
6. **Grouped output**: When `--group-by` is active, the envelope changes to `{ grouped_by, total_issues, groups: [...] }`. Verify both grouped and ungrouped paths
7. **Error output**: Exit code 2 errors must emit `{"error": true, "message": "...", "exit_code": 2}` on stdout, not stderr
8. **Determinism**: Same input must produce byte-identical JSON output. No random ordering, no timestamps unless explicitly requested

## Surface-specific checks

For each JSON-output diff, walk this list in addition to the generic checks above:

- [ ] **Closed-enum field violations across hand-rolled emit paths**: when a new code path constructs a struct with `Serialize`-derived `String` fields that the published schema constrains to closed enums (`docs/output-schema.json` `enum: [...]`), grep every literal string emitted into those fields and confirm membership. Concrete recipe: for each new `<StructWithSchema> { field: "...".to_owned(), }` in the diff, run `grep -nE '"<field>"' docs/output-schema.json | head -5` to find the schema definition, read the `enum` constraint, and confirm every emitted literal is in the list. Heuristic for which fields are at risk: the local sidecar / canonical path emits one set of values, the new hand-rolled path emits another; if the rust struct field type is `String` (not a `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")] enum`), the compiler will not catch drift. Pattern target list for runtime coverage: `evidence.static_status` (`["used","unused"]`), `evidence.test_coverage` (`["covered","not_covered"]`), `evidence.v8_tracking` (`["tracked","untracked"]`), `verdict` (already enum-typed, safe). Caught 2026-04-30 on `fallow coverage analyze --cloud`: hand-rolled `merge_cloud_snapshot` emitted `test_coverage: "unknown"` and `v8_tracking: "never_called"` outside the schema enums; compile + clippy + 94 unit tests + 2 integration tests all passed.
- [ ] **Plugin-count drift sweep across non-companion surfaces**: when the change bumps the plugin count, beyond the companion-repo flag-gate sweep AND the existing `README.md` / detection.md updates, ALSO grep these five additional in-repo locations for stale counts:
  ```bash
  /usr/bin/grep -nE "\b(89|90|91|92|93)\b.*plugin" \
    .claude/rules/plugins.md \
    .claude/rules/core-crate.md \
    docs/positioning.md \
    npm/fallow/package.json \
    npm/fallow/README.md
  ```
  Each hit must either be the new count or have an explicit reason to lag (e.g., historical tables). For `npm/fallow/skills/**`, the existing project memory `project_npm_skills_vendored_drift.md` is authoritative; those refresh at release time only and do NOT need a manual bump. The `.claude/rules/*.md` files specifically are easy to forget because they live OUTSIDE the user-facing docs surface but feed every Claude session's system context, so a stale count there silently misinforms future implement passes. Principle: the hardcoded-count check covers WHAT to compare against (the registry), not WHERE all the ascending surfaces live. Each surface that ever cites the count must be enumerated explicitly so the next bump catches all of them. Caught 2026-05-04 on the tap+tsd plugin addition: README + detection.md + companion repos got bumped, but `.claude/rules/plugins.md`, `.claude/rules/core-crate.md`, `docs/positioning.md`, `npm/fallow/package.json`, and `npm/fallow/README.md` all silently retained 89/90/91.

### JSON format audit (Phase 3a)

```bash
FALLOW_QUIET=1 fallow <command> --format json --root benchmarks/fixtures/real-world/zod 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
import json, sys
d = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(json.dumps(d, indent=2)[:2000])
"
```

Check:
- [ ] All paths are relative (no absolute paths leaking)
- [ ] `schema_version` present and correct
- [ ] New fields use correct types (int vs float vs string)
- [ ] Optional fields use `skip_serializing_if`, omitted when not applicable
- [ ] When feature flag is OFF, new fields are completely absent from JSON (not null, not empty)

## Key files

- `crates/cli/src/report/json.rs` (main JSON serialization)
- `crates/cli/src/report/mod.rs` (format dispatch, schema_version constant)
- `crates/types/src/results.rs` (result types that become JSON)

## Veto rights

Can **BLOCK** on:
- Breaking schema changes without `schema_version` bump
- Missing `actions` arrays on issues
- Non-deterministic output (random field ordering)
- Error output on stderr instead of structured JSON on stdout

## Output format

End with a verdict:

```
## Verdict: APPROVE | CONCERN | BLOCK
```

## What NOT to flag

- Human output formatting
- Internal struct layout (only the serialized output matters)
- Performance of serialization (serde is fast enough)
