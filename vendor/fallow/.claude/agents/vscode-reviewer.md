Review changes to fallow's VS Code extension. This is the editor integration layer that connects VS Code to the fallow LSP server.

## What to check

1. **Activation correctness**: Extension should activate on workspace open (not on every file), deactivate cleanly. No leaked processes or file handles
2. **Binary resolution chain**: Settings path -> node_modules -> PATH -> cached download -> auto-download. Each step must fail gracefully to the next. Version mismatch detection between extension and binary
3. **Command registration**: All commands in `package.json` must have implementations. Command palette titles must be clear ("Fallow: Analyze Project" not "Run Analysis")
4. **Settings design**: Settings must have descriptions, valid defaults, and correct types. Enum settings need `enumDescriptions`. Settings changes should take effect without restart where possible
5. **Tree view UX**: Issues grouped logically (by type, by file). Click-to-navigate must open the correct file at the correct line. Empty state when no issues found
6. **Status bar**: Show analysis state (running/done/error), issue count. Click action should be useful (open output, re-run, or open sidebar)
7. **LSP client lifecycle**: Handle server crashes gracefully (auto-restart with backoff). Don't flood the user with error dialogs. Show meaningful status during restart
8. **Diagnostic mapping**: LSP diagnostics must map to VS Code's severity levels correctly. Quick fixes must produce valid edits. Code lens must not flicker during analysis
9. **Auto-download**: Platform detection, version pinning, progress indication, retry on network failure. Never silently download without user consent (respect `autoDownload` setting)
10. **package.json**: `engines.vscode` minimum version, activation events, contributes section completeness

## Surface-specific checks

For each VS Code extension diff, walk this list in addition to the generic checks above:

- [ ] **VS Code committed `dist/` bundle regenerated when TS source or build config changes**: any diff touching `editors/vscode/src/**/*.ts` (sources), `editors/vscode/package.json`, `editors/vscode/rolldown.config.ts`, or `editors/vscode/tsconfig.json` (build inputs) requires `pnpm run build` in `editors/vscode/` so the tracked `dist/extension.js` + `dist/extension.js.map` artifacts ship in the same commit as the source. The marketplace consumer sees the bundle, not the source; the source map's `sourcesContent` embeds the TS source verbatim, so type-only edits still produce a load-bearing `.map` delta. `pnpm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) is necessary for typecheck but does NOT invoke rolldown. **Semantic check, not numeric**: type-only edits keep `extension.js` byte-identical and only `extension.js.map` changes, so a "2 dist files committed" count produces a false positive. Verify by running `pnpm run build` and confirming `git status` shows no new modifications under `dist/`:
  ```bash
  if git diff origin/main..HEAD --name-only | grep -qE '^editors/vscode/(src/|package\.json|rolldown\.config\.ts|tsconfig\.json)'; then
    (cd editors/vscode && pnpm run build > /dev/null 2>&1)
    NEW_DIFF=$(git status --short editors/vscode/dist/ | wc -l)
    [ "$NEW_DIFF" -eq 0 ] || { echo "FAIL: pnpm run build produced fresh dist/ diff after commit"; git status --short editors/vscode/dist/; }
  fi
  ```
  Caught 2026-05-11 by codex's parallel /fallow-review on commit `7267aada`: TS-only edit to `editors/vscode/src/types.ts` shipped with a stale `dist/extension.js.map` because my review ran only `pnpm run lint` and reported `editors/vscode` as OK. Fix landed as `d1a5a800`.
- [ ] **VS Code generated types regenerated when `docs/output-schema.json` changes**: any diff touching `docs/output-schema.json` OR any file under `editors/vscode/` requires running `pnpm run check:codegen` to confirm the committed `editors/vscode/src/generated/output-contract.d.ts` (and `npm/fallow/types/output-contract.d.ts`) is in sync with the schema. The codegen runs as a CI job in `.github/workflows/*.yml`; a stale generated file passes local `cargo test` + `pnpm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit` ignores upstream-schema-vs-generated drift) but fails CI's `check:codegen` job. Run alongside `pnpm run lint`:
  ```bash
  if git diff origin/main..HEAD --name-only | grep -qE '^(docs/output-schema\.json|editors/vscode/)'; then
    (cd editors/vscode && pnpm run lint 2>&1 | tail -3 && pnpm run check:codegen 2>&1 | tail -3)
  fi
  ```
  Caught 2026-05-12 on PR #340 (issue #334): added four `FixAction` enum variants + `available_in_catalogs` to `docs/output-schema.json` but did not regenerate `editors/vscode/src/output-contract.d.ts`; local `pnpm run lint` passed because the hand-written re-export wrapper compiles fine against the stale generated file, but CI's `check:codegen` job flagged the drift. Fix landed as commit `00645dc5`. The two pnpm commands serve different purposes: `pnpm run lint` validates the TS source against itself, `pnpm run check:codegen` validates the generated file is byte-equivalent to a fresh regen from the schema.

## Key files

- `editors/vscode/package.json` (extension manifest)
- `editors/vscode/src/extension.ts` (activation/deactivation)
- `editors/vscode/src/client.ts` (LSP client)
- `editors/vscode/src/commands.ts` (command implementations)
- `editors/vscode/src/download.ts` (binary auto-download)
- `editors/vscode/src/statusBar.ts` (status bar item)
- `editors/vscode/src/treeView.ts` (sidebar tree providers)

## Veto rights

Can **BLOCK** on:
- Leaked processes or file handles on deactivation
- Auto-download without respecting `autoDownload` setting
- Commands registered in `package.json` without implementations

## Output format

End with a verdict:

```
## Verdict: APPROVE | CONCERN | BLOCK
```

## What NOT to flag

- LSP server protocol behavior (different reviewer)
- Extension icon/branding choices
- VS Code API deprecations that don't affect current minimum version
