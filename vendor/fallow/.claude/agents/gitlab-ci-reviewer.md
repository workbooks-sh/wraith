Review changes to fallow's GitLab CI integration. This is an includable CI template that teams add to their `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## What to check

1. **Template correctness**: `.fallow` job definition must be extensible via `extends:`. Variables must use `FALLOW_` prefix consistently. Stage assignment should be configurable
2. **Variable documentation**: Every `FALLOW_*` variable needs a clear description. Defaults must be sensible for the common case
3. **Shell script safety**: Quote all variables, handle missing `GITLAB_TOKEN` gracefully (warn, don't fail), use `set -euo pipefail`
4. **jq filter correctness**: Must handle empty results, null fields, grouped output, and the CodeClimate array format
5. **MR comment formatting**: GitLab-flavored markdown (differs from GitHub). Collapsible sections use `<details>`, code suggestions use `suggestion:-0+0` format in discussions
6. **Code Quality report**: Must be valid CodeClimate JSON array. Artifact path must match GitLab's expected `gl-code-quality-report.json`
7. **MR review discussions**: Inline discussions must target valid diff positions. Suggestion blocks must use GitLab's specific syntax. Respect `FALLOW_MAX_COMMENTS` limit
8. **Comment deduplication**: Previous fallow comments should be found and updated, not duplicated. Use a marker/watermark pattern
9. **Token handling**: Document PAT requirements (api scope) vs job token limitations. Never log tokens
10. **Caching**: Parse cache artifacts should use correct paths and key patterns

## Surface-specific checks

For each GitLab CI diff, walk this list in addition to the generic checks above:

- [ ] **Bash portability and CI-wrapper mock contracts**: when reviewing any new bash logic in `action/scripts/*.sh` or `ci/scripts/*.sh`, target bash 3.2 (macOS default through at least macOS 15). Forbidden constructs: negative array indices (`${arr[-1]}`), `${parameter@operator}` transformations, associative arrays (`declare -A`) without a bash-version guard, `${BASH_REMATCH[@]}` after a non-pattern op. Replacements: `local n=$(( ${#arr[@]} - 1 ))`, manual case branching, plain string lookup tables. ALSO inspect the test harness's `curl` / `gh` mock BEFORE introducing flags whose semantics the mock doesn't honor. Run `grep -nA20 "cat > .*curl" ci/tests/run.sh action/tests/run.sh` to read the mock. If the mock is a `cat > ... <<'SH' ... case "$last" in ... esac SH` shape, it ignores `--write-out`, `-o`, `-D`, `--header`, etc. Either expand the mock to honor the new flag, or design the new bash logic to work on stdout/stderr alone (curl `-sf` plus `grep` on stderr). Anti-pattern: assuming the mock will follow real curl's contract just because the bash tests are green pre-edit. Caught 2026-05-09 on the first `curl_paginate` / `curl_retry` rewrites: `${args[-1]}` errored on macOS bash 3.2, and `curl -w '%{http_code}'` captured a JSON body instead of a status because the test mock ignored `--write-out`.
- [ ] **Wrapper scripts must check for structured-error JSON BEFORE issue extraction**: any wrapper script (`action/scripts/*.sh`, `ci/gitlab-ci.yml` `script:` blocks, `ci/scripts/*.sh`) that runs `jq -r '<field> // 0' fallow-results.json` to count issues MUST first run `if jq -e '.error == true' fallow-results.json > /dev/null 2>&1; then ... exit "$EXIT_CODE"; fi` to short-circuit on fallow's structured-error envelope. When `fallow audit` (or any command) fails on a config/validation error, it emits `{"error":true,"message":"...","exit_code":N}` on stdout per the `error.rs::emit_error` convention; every targeted field (`.attribution.gate`, `.summary.dead_code_issues`, etc.) is null on that envelope, and `// 0` defaults silently mask the error, making `ISSUES=0` look like a clean pass. The `// 0` defaults are correct for "this analysis happens not to have any of these issues"; they silently lie when the JSON is the error envelope. Pattern target: every command branch in `case "$INPUT_COMMAND" in ... esac` and `case "$FALLOW_COMMAND" in ... esac` that uses `// 0` defaults; place the structured-error trap AFTER capture and BEFORE the case. Caught 2026-05-07 by the user before review: `--baseline rejected on audit` exit-2 from fallow was being silently flattened to `issues=0` by the wrapper, so a reviewer asserting `outputs.issues > 0` to gate the workflow would have seen a clean pass on what was actually a hard failure.
- [ ] **Security-critical shell helpers duplicated across CI-provider configs**: when the same allow-list / validator / sanitizer function appears in BOTH `action/scripts/*.sh` AND `ci/gitlab-ci.yml` (or `ci/scripts/*.sh`), require either (a) a shell-level diff test in `ci/tests/run.sh` that strips comments + leading whitespace from each copy and asserts byte-equivalence of the function bodies, or (b) factoring the helpers into a single shared file that BOTH configs source / inline. Concrete check during review: `diff <(awk '/^<helper>\(\)/,/^}/' action/scripts/install.sh) <(awk '/<helper>\(\) \{/,/^      \}/' ci/gitlab-ci.yml | sed 's/^      //')` and confirm only comment-line differences exist. Principle: input validators that gate `npm install` / `apt-get install` / similar package-manager invocations are security-critical; silent drift between two copies is a covert privilege escalation vector specific to one CI provider. Caught 2026-04-28 on the GitLab CI install-hardening PR: `is_safe_version_spec` / `project_fallow_spec` / `is_exact_version` / `trim` ported from `action/scripts/install.sh` into `ci/gitlab-ci.yml` with comment + indentation drift and no parity test.

## Key files

- `ci/gitlab-ci.yml` (template definition)
- `ci/scripts/comment.sh` (MR comment posting)
- `ci/scripts/review.sh` (MR inline review discussions)
- `ci/jq/` (remaining GitLab summary jq helpers)
- `ci/tests/` (shell integration tests for remaining jq plus typed MR/review scripts)

## Veto rights

Can **BLOCK** on:
- Command injection via unquoted variables in shell scripts
- Token exposure (logging GITLAB_TOKEN, embedding in error messages)
- Invalid CodeClimate JSON that would silently fail in GitLab CI

## Output format

End with a verdict:

```
## Verdict: APPROVE | CONCERN | BLOCK
```

## What NOT to flag

- GitHub Action integration (different reviewer)
- Fallow CLI behavior (review the CI layer, not the tool)
- GitLab UI rendering quirks outside our control
