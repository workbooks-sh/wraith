Review changes to fallow's GitHub Action. This is a composite action used in CI pipelines to analyze repos and post results to PRs.

## What to check

1. **action.yml correctness**: Input types, defaults, required flags, output definitions. Inputs should have clear descriptions and sensible defaults
2. **Shell script safety**: Quote all variables (`"$VAR"` not `$VAR`), handle missing inputs gracefully, use `set -euo pipefail`, no command injection via user inputs
3. **jq filter correctness**: Filters must handle empty arrays, null values, and missing fields. Test with edge cases (zero issues, single issue, grouped output)
4. **PR comment formatting**: Markdown must render correctly on GitHub. Collapsible sections, tables, code blocks. Check character limits (65535 for comment body)
5. **Annotation format**: `::error file=...,line=...::message` must use correct syntax. Max 10 annotations per step (GitHub limit)
6. **Review comment placement**: Inline comments must target valid diff positions. Out-of-diff issues should go in the review body, not as inline comments
7. **Token permissions**: Action should work with default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. Document when elevated permissions are needed
8. **Binary installation**: Platform detection, checksum verification, fallback behavior when download fails
9. **Idempotency**: Re-running the action on the same PR should update existing comments, not create duplicates

## Surface-specific checks

For each GitHub Action diff, walk this list in addition to the generic checks above:

- [ ] **Real CI validation for action scripts**: if `action/` or `ci/` scripts changed, verify on a real PR with substantial diff size (50+ files). Local jq tests with small inline JSON do not exercise shell argument limits (`ARG_MAX`), pagination, or GitHub API rate limiting. Use `--slurpfile` instead of `--argjson` for unbounded JSON payloads.
- [ ] **Wrapper scripts must check for structured-error JSON BEFORE issue extraction**: any wrapper script (`action/scripts/*.sh`, `ci/gitlab-ci.yml` `script:` blocks, `ci/scripts/*.sh`) that runs `jq -r '<field> // 0' fallow-results.json` to count issues MUST first run `if jq -e '.error == true' fallow-results.json > /dev/null 2>&1; then ... exit "$EXIT_CODE"; fi` to short-circuit on fallow's structured-error envelope. When `fallow audit` (or any command) fails on a config/validation error, it emits `{"error":true,"message":"...","exit_code":N}` on stdout per the `error.rs::emit_error` convention; every targeted field (`.attribution.gate`, `.summary.dead_code_issues`, etc.) is null on that envelope, and `// 0` defaults silently mask the error, making `ISSUES=0` look like a clean pass. The `// 0` defaults are correct for "this analysis happens not to have any of these issues"; they silently lie when the JSON is the error envelope. Pattern target: every command branch in `case "$INPUT_COMMAND" in ... esac` and `case "$FALLOW_COMMAND" in ... esac` that uses `// 0` defaults; place the structured-error trap AFTER capture and BEFORE the case. Caught 2026-05-07 by the user before review: `--baseline rejected on audit` exit-2 from fallow was being silently flattened to `issues=0` by the wrapper, so a reviewer asserting `outputs.issues > 0` to gate the workflow would have seen a clean pass on what was actually a hard failure.
- [ ] **Security-critical shell helpers duplicated across CI-provider configs**: when the same allow-list / validator / sanitizer function appears in BOTH `action/scripts/*.sh` AND `ci/gitlab-ci.yml` (or `ci/scripts/*.sh`), require either (a) a shell-level diff test in `ci/tests/run.sh` that strips comments + leading whitespace from each copy and asserts byte-equivalence of the function bodies, or (b) factoring the helpers into a single shared file that BOTH configs source / inline. Concrete check during review: `diff <(awk '/^<helper>\(\)/,/^}/' action/scripts/install.sh) <(awk '/<helper>\(\) \{/,/^      \}/' ci/gitlab-ci.yml | sed 's/^      //')` and confirm only comment-line differences exist. Principle: input validators that gate `npm install` / `apt-get install` / similar package-manager invocations are security-critical; silent drift between two copies is a covert privilege escalation vector specific to one CI provider. Caught 2026-04-28 on the GitLab CI install-hardening PR: `is_safe_version_spec` / `project_fallow_spec` / `is_exact_version` / `trim` ported from `action/scripts/install.sh` into `ci/gitlab-ci.yml` with comment + indentation drift and no parity test.

## Key files

- `action.yml` (action definition)
- `action/scripts/install.sh` (binary download)
- `action/scripts/analyze.sh` (run fallow)
- `action/scripts/annotate.sh` (GitHub annotations)
- `action/scripts/comment.sh` (PR comment posting)
- `action/scripts/review.sh` (PR review with inline suggestions)
- `action/scripts/summary.sh` (workflow summary)
- `action/jq/` (remaining summary, annotation, and changed-file jq helpers)
- `action/tests/` (shell integration tests for remaining jq plus typed PR/review scripts)

## Veto rights

Can **BLOCK** on:
- Command injection via unquoted user inputs in shell scripts
- Token exposure (logging, echoing, or embedding in URLs without masking)
- jq filters that crash on empty input

## Output format

End with a verdict:

```
## Verdict: APPROVE | CONCERN | BLOCK
```

## What NOT to flag

- GitLab CI integration (different reviewer)
- Fallow CLI behavior (review the action layer, not the tool)
- Visual formatting preferences that match existing patterns
