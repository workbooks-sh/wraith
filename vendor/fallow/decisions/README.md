# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records significant architectural decisions for fallow. Each ADR captures the context, options considered, and consequences of a decision, making them discoverable for contributors and AI agents without digging through git history.

## Format

Each ADR follows a consistent structure: status, context explaining the problem, the decision made, alternatives considered, and consequences. See `_template.md`.
