When no fallow config exists outside a monorepo subpackage, this CREATES `.fallowrc.json` using `fallow init`'s framework-aware scaffolding (TypeScript / Storybook / Vitest / Jest / Playwright / React / Vue / Angular / Svelte detection, `$schema`, `entry`, `ignorePatterns`, sensible defaults) and layers the `ignoreExports` rules on top. Inside a monorepo subpackage (workspace marker `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `package.json#workspaces` / `turbo.json` / `lerna.json` / `rush.json` above the invocation directory) the create-fallback refuses and emits `skip_reason: \"monorepo_subpackage\"` with a relative `workspace_root` path; the agent should re-run `fallow init` at the workspace root or invoke from there. Set `no_create_config: true` to opt out of the create-fallback entirely (recommended for unsupervised agent flows or CI bots where silently materialising a new top-level config file would surprise the user); the duplicate-export path is skipped with `skip_reason: \"no_create_config\"` and source-file edits proceed normally. When a source file's xxh3 content hash at fix time differs from the hash captured during the in-process analysis (parallel editor save, CI rebase, or other tool mutated the file between analysis and write), the per-file fix is skipped with `skip_reason: \"content_changed\"`; the envelope's top-level `skipped_content_changed` count is incremented and the run exits with code 2 so CI surfaces the mismatch instead of treating the partial run as a clean no-op.

This skip is NOT self-healing: re-running fallow alone does not normalize the file and will loop. The agent must run `dos2unix <path>` (or instruct the user to set `git config core.autocrlf input` and re-checkout) before re-running.

Set score=true for a single 0-100 health score with letter grade (A/B/C/D/F); runs duplication analysis automatically, but the churn-backed hotspot penalty requires hotspots=true (or targets=true). Set min_score=N to fail if score drops below a threshold (CI quality gate). Set file_scores=true for per-file maintainability index (fan-in, fan-out, dead code ratio, complexity density). Set coverage_gaps=true to explicitly include static test coverage gaps: runtime files and exports with no test dependency path (not line-level coverage). A provided config file may also enable coverage gaps via rules.coverage-gaps when no health sections are explicitly selected. Set hotspots=true to identify files that are both complex and frequently changing (combines git churn with complexity). Set ownership=true (implies hotspots) to attach per-file ownership signals: bus factor, contributor count, declared CODEOWNERS owner, drift, and unowned-hotspot flag. Use ownership_email_mode=raw|handle|hash for author email privacy (default handle). Set targets=true for ranked refactoring recommendations sorted by efficiency (quick wins first), with confidence scores and adaptive percentile-based thresholds. Set trend=true to compare current metrics against the most recent saved snapshot and show per-metric deltas with directional indicators (improving/declining/stable). Implies --score.

Set summary=true to include a natural-language summary of findings alongside the structured JSON. Set coverage to a path to Istanbul-format coverage data (coverage-final.json from Jest, Vitest, c8, nyc) for accurate per-function CRAP scores instead of the default static binary model. CRAP findings carry a `coverage_source` discriminator (`istanbul`, `estimated`, or `estimated_component_inherited`); synthetic `<template>` findings on Angular `.html` files use `estimated_component_inherited` and include an `inherited_from` path to the owning `.component.ts` so agents target the component file for coverage remediation rather than the template. Angular components whose class AND template both contribute to complexity also emit a synthetic `<component>` rollup finding anchored at the worst class method's `(line, col)`. The rollup's `cyclomatic` is `worst_class_method.cyclomatic + template.cyclomatic` (the same worst-by-cyclomatic method drives both metrics; cognitive is `worst.cognitive + template.cognitive`). The `component_rollup` payload carries the pre-summation breakdown: `class_worst_function` (method name), `class_cyclomatic` / `class_cognitive` (per-method numbers), `template_path` / `template_cyclomatic` / `template_cognitive`, plus a `component` identifier derived from the .ts owner's file stem. The rollup's `suppress-line` action uses `placement: \"above-component-worst-method\"`: a `// fallow-ignore-next-line complexity` placed above the worst class method hides BOTH the per-function finding AND the rollup, so agents do not need to emit two suppression edits. Per-function and per-`<template>` entries stay alongside the rollup; ranking and `--targets` use the rollup so a template-heavy component surfaces as one unit rather than scattered medium findings. Set runtime_coverage to a path (V8 coverage directory, V8 JSON file, or Istanbul JSON file) for merged runtime runtime-coverage findings (paid feature; requires an active license via `fallow license activate`). Set min_invocations_hot=N to tune the hot-path threshold used by runtime-coverage output (default 100). Set group_by to \"owner\" (CODEOWNERS), \"directory\", \"package\" (workspace), or \"section\" (GitLab CODEOWNERS `[Section]` headers, with `owners` metadata per group) to partition results. Each group gets its own `vital_signs`, `health_score`, `findings`, `file_scores`, `hotspots`, `large_functions`, and `targets` recomputed against the group's files (top-level metrics stay project-wide).

Set gate=\"all\" or audit.gate=\"all\" in config to gate every finding. Returns JSON with verdict, summary counts per category, attribution counts, and full issue details with actions array for auto-correction. Set coverage to an Istanbul coverage-final.json path and coverage_root to an absolute coverage-data path prefix when paths need rebasing for accurate CRAP scoring in the health sub-analysis. Set group_by to \"owner\" (CODEOWNERS), \"directory\", \"package\" (workspace), or \"section\" (GitLab CODEOWNERS `[Section]` headers, with `owners` metadata per group) to partition results. Set dead_code_baseline, health_baseline, and/or dupes_baseline to per-analysis baseline file paths (as saved by `fallow dead-code|health|dupes --save-baseline`) so pre-existing issues on touched files do not dominate the verdict; only new issues not present in the respective baseline contribute. explain_skipped only changes the human-format skipped-default-ignores note (human/markdown CLI output); MCP JSON responses stay clean. Set include_entry_exports=true to also report unused exports in entry files (catches typos in framework exports like `meatdata` vs `metadata`); the CLI flag ORs with the `includeEntryExports` config value. Set runtime_coverage to a V8 coverage directory, V8 JSON file, or Istanbul coverage-final.json to fold runtime-coverage findings into the same audit invocation: agents get the `hot-path-touched` verdict alongside dead-code and complexity in one call (License-gated; informational verdict, no exit-code change). Health findings include Angular `<component>` rollups (synthetic per-component finding folding `worst_class_method + template` complexity); ranking and `--targets` use the rollup over per-function entries so a template-heavy component is surfaced as one unit. See `check_health` for the `component_rollup` payload shape. When `FALLOW_DIFF_FILE` (path to a unified diff) is set in the agent's process environment, EVERY finding (dead-code, complexity, duplication, boundary, runtime-coverage hot paths) is narrowed to source lines inside an added hunk; project-level findings (unused deps, catalog entries, dependency overrides) bypass the filter because they anchor at fixed `package.json` / `pnpm-workspace.yaml` lines a PR rarely touches. When both `FALLOW_DIFF_FILE` and `FALLOW_CHANGED_SINCE` are set, the diff wins for line-level filtering and `--changed-since` still scopes file discovery. The `runtime_coverage.verdict` also promotes `hot-path-touched` over `cold-code-detected` for PR-review contexts; the full unprioritized signal set is in `runtime_coverage.signals[]`.

Returns structured JSON with a `runtime_coverage` block containing surfaced `findings` verdicts (`safe_to_delete` / `review_required` / `low_traffic` / `coverage_unavailable`), stable content-hash IDs (`fallow:prod:<hash>`), evidence, percentile-ranked hot paths (each with `start_line` and `end_line` so consumers can match against a PR diff), and on protocol-0.3+ sidecars a `summary.capture_quality` block that flags short-window captures. The sidecar may still classify other functions as `active`, but the CLI omits those from `runtime_coverage.findings` to keep the surfaced list actionable. Tunable via `min_invocations_hot` (hot-path threshold, default 100), `min_observation_volume` (high-confidence verdict floor, default 5000), and `low_traffic_threshold` (active/low_traffic split, default 0.001). `group_by` partitions results by CODEOWNERS / directory / package / section. PR-context behavior: when `FALLOW_DIFF_FILE` (path to a unified diff) is set in the agent's process environment, the top-level `runtime_coverage.verdict` promotes `hot-path-touched` over `cold-code-detected` so reviewers see the diff-tied signal first, AND every hot path is narrowed to functions whose `[start_line, end_line]` overlaps an added hunk. `FALLOW_CHANGED_SINCE` (git ref) also scopes (file-level). Without a change scope the verdict stays cold-code-primary and all hot paths are returned. The full unprioritized list is always in `runtime_coverage.signals[]` (kebab-case strings, severity-descending). Runtime coverage can exceed the default 120s MCP subprocess timeout on multi-megabyte dumps; raise `FALLOW_TIMEOUT_SECS` accordingly. For general complexity / hotspot / CRAP analysis without a production dump, use `check_health` instead.",
