//! RAII wrapper around `std::process::Child` that registers the child's
//! PID with the process-wide signal registry on spawn and deregisters
//! on drop or explicit consume (`wait_with_output`, `wait`).
//!
//! Storage model: the wrapper OWNS the `Child` outright. The registry
//! stores only the PID. On signal, `registry::drain_and_kill` kills by
//! PID (`kill -9 <pid>` subprocess on Unix, `TerminateProcess` on
//! Windows), which does not require ownership of the `Child`. The
//! wrapper's wait then returns with a non-zero status; callers handle
//! that the same way they would handle any subprocess failure.
//!
//! Why PID-based and not Child-based: the wrapper needs to call
//! `Child::wait_with_output(self)` which consumes the Child by value.
//! If the registry also held the Child, there would be no clean way to
//! transfer ownership for the wait while still letting the signal
//! handler kill it. Storing the PID sidesteps the problem entirely:
//! kill-by-PID is a side channel that does not interfere with wait.
//!
//! Known race (small window, low consequence): a child that completes
//! naturally is reaped inside `wait_with_output` BEFORE we deregister
//! its PID from the registry. If a signal arrives in the microseconds-
//! wide window between `wait_with_output` returning and `deregister`
//! running, the drain snapshots a now-recycled PID and sends `kill -9`
//! to whatever process the kernel assigned that PID to. The window is
//! small (one async-write to a Mutex), the consequence is one stray
//! SIGKILL during shutdown, and recovery requires a more invasive
//! design (an `Arc<Mutex<Option<Child>>>` shared with the registry).
//! Documented here so future maintainers don't re-derive the trade-off.
