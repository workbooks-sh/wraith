//! Per-group health output for `--group-by`.
//!
//! When health is invoked with `--group-by package` (or any other grouping
//! mode), the orchestrator partitions the project's files by the resolver and
//! emits one [`HealthGroup`] per bucket. Each group carries its own
//! [`VitalSigns`] and [`HealthScore`] computed from the files in that group
//! alone, plus the per-file output (findings, file scores, hotspots, large
//! functions, refactoring targets) restricted to the same subset.
