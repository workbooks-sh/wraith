//! Health-finding wrappers, action context, and typed action builders.
//!
//! Three typed envelope wrappers live in this module:
//!
//! - [`HealthFinding`] flattens [`ComplexityViolation`] for the
//!   `findings[]` array and carries the typed `actions` list plus the
//!   optional audit-mode `introduced` flag.
//! - [`HotspotFinding`] flattens [`HotspotEntry`] for the
//!   `hotspots[]` array and carries a typed [`HotspotAction`] list.
//! - [`RefactoringTargetFinding`] flattens [`RefactoringTarget`] for the
//!   `targets[]` array and carries a typed [`RefactoringTargetAction`]
//!   list.
//!
//! Wire compatibility: `#[serde(flatten)]` on the inner type means every
//! array item continues to expose the inner fields at the top level
//! alongside `actions` (and `introduced` for [`HealthFinding`] only).
//! Consumers that hand-parse the JSON see no shape change.
//!
//! Audit-mode asymmetry: [`HealthFinding`] carries `introduced` because
//! `fallow audit` attributes complexity findings to the introduced /
//! inherited diff. [`HotspotFinding`] and [`RefactoringTargetFinding`] do
//! NOT carry `introduced` because hotspot ranking and refactoring targets
//! are not produced by the audit base-snapshot classifier; the pre-wrapper
//! `finding_augmentation` set `include_introduced: false` for both and the
//! typed wrappers preserve that.
