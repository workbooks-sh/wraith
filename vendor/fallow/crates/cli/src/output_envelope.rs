//! Typed envelope structs for the JSON output contract.
//!
//! Each top-level fallow command (`check`, `dupes`, `health`, `audit`,
//! `explain`, `coverage setup`, plus the bare combined invocation and the
//! CodeClimate / review-envelope side outputs) emits a distinct envelope
//! shape. This module is the schema-side source of truth for those shapes:
//! every type carries `Serialize` plus a cfg-gated `JsonSchema` derive so the
//! committed `docs/output-schema.json` can be regenerated from Rust.
//!
//! Living in `fallow-cli` rather than `fallow-types` because the body fields
//! pull in `DuplicationReport` (from `fallow-core`) and `HealthReport` (from
//! this crate), neither of which is reachable from the lower-level types
//! crate. The shared utility shapes (`SchemaVersion`, `Meta`,
//! `BaselineDeltas`, ...) still live in `fallow_types::envelope` because they
//! depend only on serde primitives.
//!
//! Runtime construction of these envelopes happens in
//! `crates/cli/src/report/json.rs`; the JSON layer builds an envelope struct
//! and converts it to a `serde_json::Value` via `serde_json::to_value`. The
//! only remaining work on the `Value` tree is path relativisation
//! (`strip_root_prefix`) and the cross-result-type suppress-line action
//! harmonizer (`harmonize_multi_kind_suppress_line_actions`); both span
//! envelope boundaries that typed wrappers do not.
//!
//! Runtime emit for the CodeClimate, review-envelope, and coverage-setup
//! shapes now flows through the typed structs in this module:
//! `crates/cli/src/report/codeclimate.rs` constructs `CodeClimateIssue`
//! directly via `cc_issue`,
//! `crates/cli/src/report/ci/review.rs::render_review_envelope` constructs
//! `ReviewEnvelopeOutput`, and
//! `crates/cli/src/coverage/mod.rs::build_setup_envelope` constructs
//! `CoverageSetupOutput`. The wire `serde_json::Value` is the
//! `serde_json::to_value(&envelope)` of those typed structs, so adding a
//! field to one of those structs automatically flows to the wire. The
//! `AuditOutput` and `ListBoundariesOutput` families remain
//! schema-source-of-truth only (their wire is still hand-built via
//! `serde_json::json!`); the drift gate keeps them honest.
