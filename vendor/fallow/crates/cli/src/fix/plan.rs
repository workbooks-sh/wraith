//! Batch-atomicity layer for `fallow fix`.
//!
//! Each per-issue-type fixer (`exports`, `enum_members`, `deps`, `catalog`)
//! accumulates `(PathBuf, Vec<u8>)` entries on a shared [`FixPlan`] instead
//! of writing directly. After all fixers run, the orchestrator commits the
//! plan: every entry is first staged to a `NamedTempFile` in the same
//! directory as the target, and only when every stage has succeeded does
//! the commit promote each temp to its final path via the existing atomic
//! rename. A failure at the stage step leaves the project untouched. A
//! failure at the rename step is reported per-path; some renames may have
//! already landed (POSIX rename is per-file atomic; there is no atomic
//! multi-rename primitive).
//!
//! The plan also carries skipped-file records (e.g. hash mismatch between
//! the in-process analysis and the on-disk content at fix time); the
//! orchestrator surfaces these in the JSON envelope and non-zero exit code.
