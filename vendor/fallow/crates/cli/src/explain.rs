Current per-instance flips: (1) `remove-catalog-entry` is `true` only when the finding's `hardcoded_consumers` array is empty (else fallow fix skips the entry to avoid breaking `pnpm install`); (2) the primary dependency action flips between `remove-dependency` (`auto_fixable: true`) and `move-dependency` (`auto_fixable: false`) based on `used_in_workspaces`; (3) `add-to-config` for `ignoreExports` is `true` when fallow fix can safely apply the action, which means EITHER a fallow config file already exists OR no config exists and the working directory is NOT inside a monorepo subpackage (the applier then creates `.fallowrc.json` using `fallow init`'s framework-aware scaffolding and layers the new rules on top); `false` inside a monorepo subpackage with no workspace-root config because the applier refuses to fragment per-package configs; (4) `update-catalog-reference` is always `false` today (catalog-switching applier not yet wired).
